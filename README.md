#Image Classification with TensorFlow

Description:

This project tackles the task of image classification using the powerful capabilities of TensorFlow. It leverages deep learning architectures to accurately identify and categorize objects within images.

Key Features:

- TensorFlow Integration: Seamlessly utilizes TensorFlow's libraries and functionalities to build and train a robust image classification model.
- Customizable Architecture: The code allows for flexibility in choosing or designing the neural network architecture that best suits your specific classification problem.
- Data Preprocessing: Implements essential image preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
- Training and Evaluation: Provides a well-structured training process with clear loss visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.
- We are gonna be using the Convolutional Neural Network here.
  
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have Python (version 3. x recommended) and TensorFlow installed. You can install them using pip install tensorflow.
- At least you have the basic knowledge of the CNN model(like where to implement it, how does it work).For your help i aslo write the comments so that you can refer to the code comments or documentation for specific requirements.

Project Setup:

Clone this repository using git clone https://your_repository_url.git.
Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies: python -m venv venv and source venv/bin/activate.

Data Preparation:

Please prepare your image dataset, making sure it's well-organized into labeled folders or using a suitable format for TensorFlow's data loading functions.
Adjust the data paths in the code to point to your dataset location.

Customization:

Experiment with different neural network architectures by modifying the model definition section in the code.
Explore various data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
To optimize performance, Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer settings.
